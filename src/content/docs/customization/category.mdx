The category group is supported by default, if you do not want to show the group, you can disable it by setting the `SUPPORT_CATEGORY_GROUP` to `false` in the `src/lib/constants.ts` file.

```ts
// support category group, default is true (aka, show category group)
// NOTE: if you set true, you should make sure each category belongs to a group
// if you set false, the category will be shown in the root level
export const SUPPORT_CATEGORY_GROUP = false;
```
