Mkdirs support two kinds of Item Card: `Card with Image` and `Card with Icon` (default).

Item Card with Image ([item-card.tsx](https://github.com/MkdirsHQ/mkdirs-template/blob/main/src/components/item/item-card.tsx)):

Item Card with Icon ([item-card-2.tsx](https://github.com/MkdirsHQ/mkdirs-template/blob/main/src/components/item/item-card-2.tsx)):

![Item Card with Icon](../../../assets/images/guide-item-card-icon.png)


`Card with Icon` is the default style, and you can change it to `Card with Image` by setting the `SUPPORT_ITEM_ICON` to `false` in the `src/lib/constants.ts` file.

```ts
// support item icon, default is true (aka, show item icon)
// NOTE: if you set true, you should make sure the item icon is available
// if you set false, the item card will show image instead of icon
export const SUPPORT_ITEM_ICON = false;
```

<Aside type="note">
    - If you change to `Card with Image`, you need to add image to all items.
    - If you change to `Card with Icon`, you need to add icon and image to all items.
    - If you change to `Card with Icon`, you can also use `Card with Image` component.
