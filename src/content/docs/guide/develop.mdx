## Folder Structure

It's simply a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), so the folder structure of the Mkdirs is as follows:

## Git

### How to sync the source code

If you have followed the steps in the [Installation](/docs/installation), and you have a repository named `@your-github-username/your-mkdirs`.

Follow the steps below to sync the source code from `@Mkdirs/mkdirs-template` to your own repository if some updates are available, for example, new features or bug fixes.

<Steps>

1. Add the upstream repository

    First, you need to add the original repository as a remote repository. 
    
    You can name it `upstream`, and run the following command in your local repository:

    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/MkdirsHQ/mkdirs-template.git
    ```

2. Fetch upstream changes
    
    Run the following command to fetch all branches and commits from the original repository:

    ```bash
    git fetch upstream
    ```

3. Switch to your main branch
    
    Make sure you're on your main branch (usually main or master):

    ```bash
    git checkout main
    ```

4. Merge upstream changes
    
    Now, merge the changes from the upstream main branch into your local main branch:

    ```bash
    git merge upstream/main --allow-unrelated-histories
    ```

    If you don't want to merge all the changes from the upstream main branch, you can also cherry-pick the specific commits that you want to apply to your local main branch:

    ```bash
    git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
    ```

5. Resolve conflicts (if any)

    If conflicts occur during the merge (mainly due to you have made some changes to the source code already), you'll need to resolve them manually. 
    
    After resolving, use `git add` to add the modified files, then use `git commit` to commit the changes.

6. Push to your own repository
    
    Finally, push the updated local main branch to your own repository:

    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

</Steps>

By following these steps, you can keep your fork in sync with the original repository. It's recommended to perform this process regularly to ensure your fork doesn't fall too far behind.
