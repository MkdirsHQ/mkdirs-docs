## Add custom pages

Go to the Sanity Studio, click the `Pages` button, and then click the `Create` button.

Input the page title, and generate the slug, then click the `Publish` button.

After the page is published, you can see the page in the website via the URL `/[slug]`.

<Aside type="note">
    Please make sure the slug is unique, and it is listed in the `publicRoutes` array in the `src/routes.ts` file, otherwise the page will be redirected to the login page.
