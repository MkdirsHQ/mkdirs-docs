I personally recommend using [Dokploy](https://dokploy.com/) to deploy Mkdirs, because it's much easier to setup the whole thing and you get the CI/CD pipeline like Vercel out of the box.

## Deploy on Dokploy

<Steps>

1. Create a new project on Dokploy

    Click on "Create project" and set the project name and description.

2. Create an application in the project

    Click on "Create services" and select "Application", then set the application name and description.

3. Set the source code and build type

    Set the source code to the repository, and set the build type to Dockerfile.

4. Set the environment variables

    Copy the content from the `.env` file and paste them in environment settings.

5. Set the domain

    Add the domain you want to use, and make sure to check on "HTTPS".
