### How to import the data from other directory websites?

You can write a script to export the data from other directory websites, and then import the data to Mkdirs.

We have provided some example scripts in the codebase, you can refer to them for more information. 

For example, you can use the [Sanity CLI](https://www.sanity.io/docs/cli-reference) feature or [Sanity Client API](https://www.sanity.io/docs/js-client) to import the data to Mkdirs.

### How to learn more about Sanity CMS?

You can checkout this [guide](https://docs.mkdirs.com/guide/sanity/) for the detailed instructions.

You will learn how to update the Sanity schemas, and how to configure the Sanity Studio, etc.

We also provide a [list of tutorials and documents](https://docs.mkdirs.com/guide/sanity/#further-reading) about Sanity CMS, you can refer to them for more information.

### Does Mkdirs support internationalization?

No, Mkdirs does not support internationalization, and will not support it in the future, because it will make the boilerplate too heavy.

I have open sourced another [Directory Boilerplate](https://github.com/javayhu/free-directory-boilerplate), which supports internationalization, you can refer to it for more information.

But you can easily add more languages, because Mkdirs is built with Next.js and Sanity CMS, both of which support internationalization.

- Next.js: [https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/internationalization](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/internationalization)
- Sanity: [https://www.sanity.io/docs/localization](https://www.sanity.io/docs/localization)

## Payment

### Does Mkdirs support Lemonsqueezy or other payment services?

No, Mkdirs does not support Lemonsqueezy or other payment services, only Stripe is supported.

If you want to support Lemon Squeezy, you can refer to this open source project.

### How much does it cost to run a directory website?

With Mkdirs, you can easily launch a directory website for almost zero cost.

You only pay for your domain, and start with the free plan of [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/pricing) and [Resend](https://resend.com/pricing) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/pricing).

When the traffic of your directory website grows, you can choose to upgrade your plans later.
