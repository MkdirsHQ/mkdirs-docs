Mkdirs uses [Resend](https://resend.com/) as the email service.

<Steps>

1. Create an account on [Resend](https://resend.com/)

    If don't have an account on Resend, follow their steps to signup [here](https://resend.com/signup).

2. Get the Resend API key

    After signin on Resend, you can create your first API key, and set it to the `.env` file.

    ```bash
    # .env
    # [only required if you want to authenticate users by email/password]
    RESEND_API_KEY=your_api_key
    ```

3. Set the email address to send the emails from

    When your application sends an email, for example, signup emails or reset password emails, the email will be sent from the following email address:

    ```bash
    # .env
    # [only required if you want to authenticate users by email/password]
    RESEND_EMAIL_FROM=support@example.com
    ```

4. Set the email address to receive the notification emails

    When there is a new submission from a customer, a notification email will be sent to the following email address:

    ```bash
    # .env
    # [only required if you want to receive notification emails]
    RESEND_EMAIL_ADMIN=admin@example.com
    ```

5. Set the audience id for newsletter

    Create a new audience in Resend and copy the audience id, then set it to the `.env` file.

    Audience is used to send newsletter emails to your subscribers.

    ```bash
    # .env
    # [only required if you want to support newsletter]
    RESEND_AUDIENCE_ID=your_audience_id
    ```
