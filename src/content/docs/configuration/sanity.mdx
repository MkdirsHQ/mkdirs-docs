<Steps>

1. Create an account on [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/)

    If don't have an account on Sanity, follow their steps to signup [here](https://www.sanity.io/login/sign-up).

2. Create a new project

    After signin on Sanity, you can create your first project [here](https://www.sanity.io/manage?new-project).

3. Set the project id to the `.env` file

    After creating the project, you will see the project id under the project name.

    ```bash
    # .env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id;
    ```

4. Set the dataset to the `.env` file

    The default dataset is `production`, and you can create a new dataset or use the default one.

    ```bash
    # .env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=your_dataset;
    ```

5. Set API token to the `.env` file

    Go to the project API settings, click on `Add API token`, create a new token with the permissions of `Editor`, and set it to the `.env` file.

    ```bash
    # .env
    SANITY_API_TOKEN=your_api_token;
    ```

6. Set the CORS origins

    Go to the project API settings, click on `Add CORS origin`, add the origin of your domain (e.g. `https://mkdirs.com`) or `http://localhost:3000` for local development
