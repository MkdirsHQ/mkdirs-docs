Mkdirs uses [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) or [OpenPanel](https://openpanel.dev/) as the analytics service, but you can also add other analytics services, and we will support more in the future.

## Google Analytics

Follow the [official guide](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9304153) to set up Google Analytics for a website.

Then copy the Google Analytics ID, and set it to the `.env` file.

```bash
# .env
# [only required if you are using Google Analytics]
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=your_google_analytics_id;
```

## OpenPanel Analytics

<Steps>

1. Create an account on [OpenPanel](https://openpanel.dev//login)

   Follow the steps [here](https://dashboard.openpanel.dev/login) to create your account.

2. Create a new project

   Hit the `Create Project` button, enter the name of your project, and click the `Create` button.

3. Create a new client

   Hit the `...` button next to the project name, and select `Projects`.

   Hit the `New Client` button, and enter the domain, then click the `Create` button.

4. Set the OpenPanel Client ID to the `.env` file

   Once the client is created, copy the `Client ID` and set it to the `.env` file.

    ```bash
    # .env
    # [only required if you are using OpenPanel]
    NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENPANEL_CLIENT_ID=your_open_panel_client_id;
    ```
